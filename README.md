# Smart Calculator
Jetbrains Academy Project

## About
Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

## Objectives
* Stage 1: 2+2
    * Your calculator is taking its first steps: teach it to calculate the sum of two integers and display the result on the screen.
* Stage 2:2+2+
    * Enable your calculator to keep adding numbers in a loop until the user enters “exit”.
* Stage 3: Count them all
    * Using lists and strings, make it possible to calculate sums of multiple integers.
* Stage 4: Add subtractions
    * Where there is a plus, there is a minus. Using your knowledge of lists and strings, enable the calculator to deal with subtraction as well as addition.
* Stage 5: Error!
    * There’s no math without errors: teach your program to alert the user to errors in the case of invalid input.
* Stage 6: Variables
    * Working with dict, enable the calculator to use variables.
* Stage 7: I've got the power
    * Time to upgrade and add even more possible operations: multiplication, division, powers, and calculations in parentheses.
